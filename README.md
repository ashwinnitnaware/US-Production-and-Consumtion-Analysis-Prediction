# US Production and Consumtion Analysis Prediction
 Built Arima, Sarima traditional model and RNN, LSTM, GRU, XGboost machine learning model for details analysis to see trends and seasonality of US Energy Production and Consumption. The dataset main dependent variables were consumption and production, and independent variables were import, export, industrial consumption, stock change, and time. Training the models on 45 years of dataset and then predicting energy consumption and production for next 5 year. GRU machine learning model outperformed as compared to all models.
